          <li>Complete the Advisor Agreement Form and hit "Finish"</li>

        <h2>Advisor Manual</h2>
        <p>The American College Personnel Association (ACPA), has developed a standardized Advisor Manual as a resource for all advisors. Review the manual for information regarding benefits, advising styles, do's & don'ts, event planning, parliamentary
          procedure and more.</p>
        <p><a href="https://orgsync.com/48580/files/199716/show">ACPA Advisor Manual</a></p>

        <h2>Advisor Roundtables</h2>
        <p>In an effort to assist student organization advisors in their role, the Involvement Center coordinates two Advisor Roundtables per semester. Below are dates for the fall semester. Advisors will receive meeting invitations via Outlook from Kelsey
          Tempas, Graduate Intern in the Involvement Center for all roundtables.</p>

        <p>General Support</p>
        <p>The Involvement Center is also here for general support for all student organizations. If you have questions regarding advising, policies, OrgSync or general org support, please feel free to contact Krista Proksch, Involvement Coordinator, at
          <a href="mailto:prokschk@uwstout.edu">prokschk@uwstout.edu</a> or 715.232.1765.</p>

        <h2>Advisor FAQ's</h2>
        <p>See below for the most frequently asked questions of advisors.</p>
        <p><b>There's been a change in advisors. What needs to happen?</b></p>
        <p>Have the organization leaders update their <a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/73167741">OrgSync portal's profile</a>. It's required of the organizations to update their profile anytime throughout the year when there is a change in officers, constitutional updates, advisor changes, etc. Once a student organization inputs the the current advisor's name and email, the advisor will automatically be sent an email to review the organization's profile and submit the Advisor Agreement form.</p>
        <p><b>I'm unable to advise the student organization anymore. What should I do?</b></p>
        <p>Email <a href="mailto:prokschk@uwstout.edu">Krista Proksch</a> and the <a href="mailto:ssaorgaffairs@uwstout.edu">SSA Organizational Affairs Director</a> to let them know you're resigning as the advisor. Once an advisor resigns, the Organizational Affairs Committee of the SSA gives orgs 30 days to find a new advisor before losing rights of a recognized org.</p>
        <p><b>Do I have to submit the advisor agreement every time I receive a Review Request from OrgSync?</b></p>
        <p>No you do not! Advisors only need to submit the agreement once a year (during the renewal period or whenever you begin as the advisor). Due to the way profile updates work in OrgSync, you will always receive an email every time the organization makes a profile update. You can review it if you wish as a way to keep yourself informed on what changes, but you do not have to click the "Submit Review Form" each time.</p>
